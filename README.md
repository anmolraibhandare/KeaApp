### Setup
Clone the app to your local machine
KeaApp is built using Swift and Firebase. Dependencies are managed using CocoaPods.

1. Setup Firebase for the app to get `GoogleService-info.plist` file. Link to setup firebase can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)
2. Run `pod install` in the Source directory, open `.xcworkspace` file and build the project
3. Create a new database named `users` within your firebase account. Add a new Cloud Firestore collection `users` with firstname, lastname, uid, email and password
4. Your Firebase should now be linked with Kea, now run the project
5. The application should prompt to activate location services. Make sure to `Allow location services`. If not active, go to Settings -> Privacy -> Location Services -> Turn on or enable `While using the App`

  > **_NOTE:_** - *Please make sure to setup Firebase and to activate location services to run the application as intended.*\
  *To check persistence, you can close the app within the simulator by holding `Command âŒ˜` + `Shift` + Double tapping 'H'*
